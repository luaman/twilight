NEWS for Project Twilight
-------------------------

0.1.0 release

2001-09-14 05:15  New Cvar, fs_gamename
	This read-only Cvar can be set to cause a game other than id1 to be
	loaded at startup time.  It's provided for truly total conversions
	and for allowing both the full and shareware games to be installed
	on the same machine.

2001-09-13 05:36  Set configuration files
	Two new Cvars, fs_shareconf and fs_userconf now exist which can be
	used for those set commands which must be supplied on the command
	line.  No more need to type +set fs_userpath or -basedir on a win32
	system, just put set fs_userpath c:\quake or whatever in the file
	twilight.rc in your windows directory.  On posix systems, the files
	default to /etc/twilight.conf and ~/.twilightrc.  The per-user
	config overrides the shared config, and the command line overrides
	both as expected.

2001-09-10 11:27  New Cvar, skybox
	If you prefer skyboxes found in later games to the Quake sky, this
	Cvar can be used to load one.

2001-09-09 17:13  New Cvars for console display
	The cl_verstring Cvar controls the program identification string
	shown at the bottom of the console.  The default value is the name
	and version, as expected.  gl_constretch controls whether or not the
	console background image slides up and down or stretches from the
	top of the screen.  The latter is the default, for a nice effect.

2001-09-09 05:25  Hardware gamma ramp support
	The gamma Cvar now works differently than it used to, higher numbers
	are brighter rather than darker.
		FIXME: Explain this and list Cvars

2001-09-08 10:39  New Cvar in NQ, show_fps
	Adds FPS counter to twilight-nq, works just like it does in QW.

2001-09-08 08:31  Colored dynamic lighting
	Dynamic lightmaps may now contain color.
		FIXME: Explain better, list Cvars involved

2001-09-01 15:27  New commandline parameter, -bpp
	Specifies the color depth in bits per pixel.  Note, most OpenGL
	implementations consider the supplied value a minimum rather than an
	absolute.

2001-08-26 17:56  New Cvar, r_waterwarp
	The r_waterwarp Cvar controls the underwater effect.  Set it to 0 to
	disable.  The old effect can be achieved with r_waterwarp 8.  Other
	values increase or decrease turbulence.

2001-08-26 17:17  New Cvars for file locations
	The fs_sharepath Cvar allows you to set the location of shared
	gamedata, which is considered read-only and is useful on multiuser
	systems and network drives.  fs_userpath sets the read-write
	location which overrides fs_sharepath.  The -basedir parameter is
	still supported and simply sets fs_userpath to the appropriate
	value.  Both Cvars must be set before the game initializes using
	+set on the command line.

2001-08-25 19:35  Software brightness and contrast
	Controls for brightness and contrast using OpenGL rendering tricks
	has been added.  It tends to slow things down a bit, so hardware
	controls should be preferred if available.
		FIXME: Note Cvar names

2001-08-25 07:59  Support for dynamic lights using PVS
	Dynamic lights have been sped up dramatically by only drawing those
	lights which fall within the PVS.
		FIXME: Note the Cvar name

2001-08-24 22:00  Support for shutter 3D glasses removed
	It never worked in the first place.  There was a fixme in the code
	about eventually making it work someday, but that never happened and
	isn't going to happen now, so..

2001-08-22 04:45  Support for +use has been added
		FIXME: I don't know what this is for, still..

2001-08-21 21:57  Improved tab completion
	The tab completion feature has been improved a bit and will now give
	you a list of possible completions.

2001-08-21 13:40  Fullbright textures on models
	Models and bmodels can now use fullbright pixels in their skins as
	was always intended.  This is an important feature in some maps
	where certain models you should always be able to see a glowing
	light from were totally black.
		FIXME: Note the Cvars

2001-08-19 13:06  New console command, set
	The console command set allows you to change the value of a Cvar.
	Its primary intended use in Quake is on the command line as +set,
	which allows you to set the value of a Cvar, overriding the default
	values for certain read-only Cvars which cannot be changed later.

2001-08-12 05:51  Dynamic OpenGL library loading
	Project Twilight now supports a new Cvar to control which OpenGL
	library is used.  This is more useful to developers than users, but
	users with more than one video card may find use for it as well.
	The Cvar is gl_driver, and its default is libGL.so.1 on POSIX
	systems and opengl32.dll on Win32.

2001-08-12 02:59  Time cheat detection
	QW trusts the time on the client too much, causing an absolutely
	trivial cheat allowing players to be so fast they can outrun a
	rocket can jump so high that they are literally flying.  Detecting
	it is not an exact science since Win32 QWCL 2.30 contains a bug
	which causes it to cheat in the same manner.  The Cvars to control
	detection sensitivity are:
		FIXME: Add Cvars here!

2001-08-10 10:59  New graphics menu
	A new menu for graphics options has been created under options to
	control many of the new settings which have been added that affect
	the speed and prettyness of the engine.

2001-08-09 04:51  Frame interpolation
	Interpolation is the process if blending two network frames to
	smooth out animations.  This is on by default, but turning it off
	will speed things up if the engine runs sluggishly.  The Cvars to
	use are:
		FIXME: Add Cvars here!

2001-08-08 15:48  cmdline param -lm_4 fixed [REMOVED]
	The engine has always had support for RGBA lightmaps, they just
	didn't actually work and were never used for anything.

2001-07-27 10:19  autoconf/automake support
	Users who compile Project Twilight using POSIX-compliant systems
	will be relieved to find that the code is now built using autoconf
	and automake.  We'll also support compiling with mingw32.

2001-07-27 01:19  IPX support removed
	IPX support only worked in win32 and was not stable.  Use TCPIP.

2001-07-23 04:02  New cmdline param -sharedir [REMOVED]
	If you want to install gamedata to a shared filesystem or a network
	drive, you can specify the path with -sharedir.  You may use this
	with -basedir to have your gamedata and customizations in different
	places.

2001-07-10 13:55  IDGODS back door removed
	The original Quake featured a compile-time back door which slipped
	in to at least one Id release.  To prevent it from ever happening in
	Project Twilight, the code was removed.

2001-07-09 06:52  8-bit 3Dfx OpenGL support removed
	It's not any faster on a Voodoo2, which is our low-end target.  It
	is also extremely ugly.

2001-07-09 06:47  Pause message
	A long-time bug in QW in which the pause messages were backwards has
	been fixed.
