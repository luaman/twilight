NEWS for Project Twilight
-------------------------
Last Updated: $Id$

0.1.0 release

2001-09-14 05:15  New Cvar, fs_gamename
	This read-only Cvar can be set to cause a game other than id1 to be
	loaded at startup time.  It's provided for truly total conversions
	and for allowing both the full and shareware games to be installed
	on the same machine.  This Cvar must be set before the engine is
	initialized.

2001-09-13 05:36  Set configuration files
	Two new Cvars, fs_shareconf and fs_userconf now exist which can be
	used for those set commands which must be supplied on the command
	line.  No more need to type +set fs_userpath or -basedir on a win32
	system, just put set fs_userpath c:\quake or whatever in the file
	twilight.rc in your windows directory.  On posix systems, the files
	default to /etc/twilight.conf and ~/.twilightrc.  The per-user
	config overrides the shared config, and the command line overrides
	both as expected.

2001-09-10 11:27  New Cvar, skybox
	If you prefer skyboxes found in later games to the Quake sky, this
	Cvar can be used to load one.  Place the six Targa images of a
	Q2 style skybox into a mod's gfx/env/ directory and set the skybox
	Cvar to the base name of the skybox, eg "set skybox snow2".  Set it
	to an empty string to disable.

2001-09-09 17:13  New Cvars for console display
	The cl_verstring Cvar controls the program identification string
	shown at the bottom of the console.  The default value is the name
	and version, as expected.  gl_constretch controls whether or not the
	console background image slides up and down or stretches from the
	top of the screen.  The latter is the default, for a nice effect.

2001-09-09 05:25  Hardware gamma ramp support

	The scale used by the gamma Cvar was significantly different than is
	by other software, most likely including your video drivers.  Higher
	numbers now brighten the screen, with most monitors using a gamma
	of about 2.0 on average.  We now support both software and hardware
	gamma controls on this scale.  Here's a rundown of the Cvars used to
	control the gamma:
		v_hwgamma - 1 if hardware gamma is to be used
		v_gamma - overall hardware gamma control
		v_gammabias_r - hardware gamma, red channel
		v_gammabias_g - hardware gamma, green channel
		v_gammabias_b - hardware gamma, blue chanel
		v_tgamma - texture (software) gamma control
		v_tgammabias_r - texture gamma, red channel
		v_tgammabias_g - texture gamma, green channel
		v_tgammabias_b - texture gamma, blue channel

	The texture gamma controls are read-only once the engine has started
	up and must be set before then at this time.  [2001-09-17, the gamma
	Cvar has been renamed v_gamma to keep from breaking old
	configurations, this change is reflected above.]

2001-09-08 10:39  New Cvar in NQ, show_fps
	Added FPS counter to twilight-nq, works just like it does in QW.

2001-09-08 08:31  Colored dynamic lighting
	Dynamic lightmaps can now be generated using colored lighting.
		gl_colorlights - 1 to use normal dynamic lighting
			         0 to use dynamic lighting w/ color
	This Cvar is read-only once the engine is initialized.

2001-09-01 15:27  New commandline parameter, -bpp
	Specifies the color depth in bits per pixel.  Note, most OpenGL
	implementations consider the supplied value a minimum rather than an
	absolute.

2001-08-26 17:56  New Cvar, r_waterwarp
	The r_waterwarp Cvar controls the underwater effect.  Set it to 0 to
	disable.  The old effect can be achieved with r_waterwarp 8.  Other
	values increase or decrease turbulence.

2001-08-26 17:17  New Cvars for file locations
	The fs_sharepath Cvar allows you to set the location of shared
	gamedata, which is considered read-only and is useful on multiuser
	systems and network drives.  fs_userpath sets the read-write
	location which overrides fs_sharepath.  The -basedir parameter is
	still supported and simply sets fs_userpath to the appropriate
	value.  Both Cvars are read-only once the engine is initialized and
	must be changed on the command line using +set.

2001-08-25 19:35  Software brightness and contrast
	Controls for brightness and contrast using OpenGL rendering tricks
	have been added.  It lowers framerate a little, so the hardware
	gamma control should be used instead if it works. However, a
	combination of software brightness and hardware gamma can produce some
	greatly improved visual acuity.
		r_brightness - range of 1 to 5
		r_contrast - range of .75 to 1 (.025 increments recommended)

2001-08-25 07:59  Support for dynamic lights using PVS
	Dynamic lights have been sped up dramatically by only drawing those
	lights which fall within the current PVS (potentially viewable set -
	what the player can potentially see on the screen currently).
		gl_oldlights - 1 to use normal dynamic lights
			       0 to use PVS dynamic lights

2001-08-24 22:00  Support for shutter 3D glasses removed
	It never worked in the first place.  There was a fixme in the code
	about eventually making it work someday, but that never happened and
	isn't going to happen now, so it has been removed.

2001-08-21 21:57  Improved tab completion
	The tab completion feature has been improved a bit and will now give
	you a list of possible completions.

2001-08-21 13:40  Fullbright textures on models
	Models and bmodels can now use fullbright pixels in their skins as
	was always intended.  This is an important feature in some maps
	where certain models should always emit a glowing light, without this
	they are completely dark.
		gl_fb_bmodels - make medpacks/health, etc. fullbright
		gl_fb_models - make level models fullbright (torches, etc.)

2001-08-19 13:06  New console command, set
	The console command set allows you to change the value of a Cvar.
	It is not required in NQ/QW for reasons of backward compatibility,
	but is useful on the command line to set certain Cvars which may not
	be modified after the engine is initialized, such as gl_driver.  An
	example of how to use it:
		twilight-nq +set gl_driver "libMesaGL.so.3"
		twilight-qw +set gl_driver "3dfxogl.dll"

2001-08-12 05:51  Dynamic OpenGL library loading
	Project Twilight now supports a new Cvar to control which OpenGL
	library is used.  This is more useful to developers than users, but
	users with more than one video card may find use for it as well.
	The Cvar is gl_driver, and its default is libGL.so.1 on POSIX
	systems and opengl32.dll on Win32.

2001-08-12 02:59  Time cheat detection
	QW trusts the time on the client too much, causing an absolutely
	trivial cheat allowing players to be so fast they can outrun a
	rocket can jump so high that they are literally flying.  Detecting
	it is not an exact science since Win32 QWCL 2.30 contains a bug
	which causes it to cheat in the same manner.  The Cvars to control
	detection sensitivity are:
		sv_timekick
		sv_timekick_allowed
		sv_timekick_interval
		FIXME: explain cvars

2001-08-10 10:59  New graphics menu
	A new menu for graphics options has been created under options to
	control many of the new settings which have been added that affect
	the speed and visual quality of the engine.

2001-08-09 04:51  Frame interpolation
	Interpolation is the process of blending two network frames to
	smooth out animations.  This is on by default, but turning it off
	will speed things up if the engine runs sluggishly.  The Cvars to
	use are:
		gl_im_animation	- smooth model animation
		gl_im_transform - smooth model rotation (weapons, etc.)

2001-08-08 15:48  cmdline param -lm_4 fixed [REMOVED]
	The engine has always had support for RGBA lightmaps, they just
	didn't actually work and were never used for anything.

2001-07-27 10:19  autoconf/automake support
	Users who compile Project Twilight using POSIX-compliant systems
	will be relieved to find that the code is now built using autoconf
	and automake.  We'll also support compiling with mingw32.

2001-07-27 01:19  IPX support removed
	IPX support only worked in win32 and was not stable.  Use TCP/IP.

2001-07-23 04:02  New cmdline param -sharedir [REMOVED]
	If you want to install gamedata to a shared filesystem or a network
	drive, you can specify the path with -sharedir.  You may use this
	with -basedir to have your gamedata and customizations in different
	places.

2001-07-10 13:55  IDGODS back door removed
	The original Quake featured a compile-time back door which slipped
	in to at least one id Software release.  To prevent it from ever happening
	in Project Twilight, the code was removed.

2001-07-09 06:52  8-bit 3Dfx OpenGL support removed
	8-bit 3Dfx OpenGL support was only faster on a Voodoo 1, it's not any
	faster on a Voodoo2, which is our low-end target.  It is also extremely
	ugly.

2001-07-09 06:47  Pause message
	A long-time bug in QW in which the pause messages were backwards has
	been fixed.
