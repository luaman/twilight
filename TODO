Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

These things should be done before first public release:

  - Add Cvars fs_sharepath and fs_userpath
  - Global config file support
  - Website updates
    - MySQL-based news
    - Important non-project files
    - Releases page
    - Credits page
    - A few links to important sites
    - Overview update to reflect changing project dynamics
    - CVS walktrhoughs
    - Anything else we can get done by release date
  - Packaging scripts
    - Debian
    - RPM
    ? Something for win32?


Would be nice but is not strictly needed, in importance order:

  - Rid ourselves of the monolithic header
  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Produce a dedicated server for NQ
  - Nightly CVS snapshots
  - Prettiness features all around
  - Console font
  - Menu overhaul
  - Knghtbrd's server console


Stuff that can wait:

  - Add PNG loader
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
  - SDL improvements
    - Replace snd_* with SDL-based audio
    - MacOS/MacOS X ports
    - Remove Quake-specific simple datatypes which SDL gives us
    - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
    - Replace Quake library functions with SDL functions
  - Cvar improvements
    - Convert from an unsorted list to a hash
    - Implement CVAR_TEMP for progs-created vars
    - Implement Cvar_Clean to delete CVAR_TEMPs that aren't CVAR_USER
    - Implement flag manipulation functions for internal use
    - Use Cvar callbacks for Cvar bounds checking and internal updates
  - Command-specific tab completion (set, map, etc)


Stuff that definitely should wait:

  - The New Protocol(TM)
  - Zip archive support
  - Design a new HUD system
  - Change resolutions in-game
