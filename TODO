Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

These things are done:
  - Make +set happen as early as possible

These things need to be done before first public release:

  - Add Cvars fs_sharepath and fs_userpath
  - Global config file support
  - Website updates
    - Important non-project files
    - Releases page
    - IRC info
    - Credits page
    - A few links to important sites
    - Overview update to reflect changing project dynamics
    - CVS walktrhoughs
    - Anything else we can get done by release date
  - Packaging scripts
  - cvs2cl target in autoconf to keep the ChangeLog current

Would be nice but is not strictly needed, in importance order:

  - Rebuild Frosty's (irc bot's) source and put it in CVS
  - MySQL-based news
  - Fix targa loader
  - Mac port
  - Produce a dedicated server for NQ
  - Convert Cvars from list to hash
  - SDL audio, massive portability bonus to doing this now
  - Rid ourselves of the monolithic header
  - Nightly CVS snapshots
  - Use SDL datatypes where appropriate
  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Prettiness features all around
  - Console font
  - Use callbacks for Cvars where appropriate
  - Menu overhaul
  - Knghtbrd's server console
  - Use SDL functions to simplify code


Stuff that can wait:

  - Add PNG loader
  - Zip archive support
  - Cvar improvements
    - Implement CVAR_TEMP for progs-created vars
    - Implement Cvar_Clean to delete CVAR_TEMPs that aren't CVAR_USER
    - Implement flag manipulation functions for internal use


Stuff that definitely should wait:

  - The New Protocol(TM)
  - Design a new HUD system
  - Change resolutions in-game
