Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

Stuff keeping 0.2.0 from being released: (Items may be repeated below.)
  - Add 3dfx quirk to limit vertex array size.
    (Do we need to limit indices too?)
    (Need output of start and gl_info from a windows 3Dfx box for this.)
  - Find and fix twibugs_qwsv_time_jump.
  - Get /sane/ lerping for both NQ and QW. (Even QW is currently a mess.)
    (If LH could please do this.)
  - Add the rest of the items that need doing to the list.
    (And then do them!)
  - Need to fix twibugs_userpath.
  
Bugs we know about:

  - Damm can demonstrate lightmap corruption consistantly with certain
    maps at certain times.  He can't reproduce it at will, but it does
    happen.
  - lights do not react to moving bmodels, untransforming into the
    bmodel's coordinates would fix this.  This is a stock Quake bug.
  - Quake never checked BSPs very well, a bad one can crash the engine.
  - Twilight uses far too much memory.  Textures should be freed when they
    are uploaded for one, and we should use fewer big static buffers.

New stuff slated for 0.2.0:

stuff slate for EvilTypeGuy for 0.2.0:
  - clean up the menus, make sure all cvar graphics options
    are listed on the graphics options menu in both nq/qw
  - clean up the Cmd system

Would be nice but is not strictly needed:

  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Build a seperate dedicated server in NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
    (Largely done.)
  - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
  - Convert Cvars from an unsorted list to a hash
  - Use traceline to determine visibility (trace from eye to random places
    in entity bbox), with 1 second visibility timeout (if traceline
    succeeds, reset timeout to realtime + 1), this is as fast as pvs
    checking, and much more effective, use this in server and optionally
    client
  - Add back mirrors at some point
  - Rewrite the sound code so that it is possible to spit out a timed
    sound file which matches frame outputs (for recording videos)
  - JPEG screenshots
  - Add {gl,cl}_weirdshit.c to support Nehahra.  ;)
  - Nehahra needs fog support.
  - Nehahra needs alpha (alias/bmodel).
    (Likely not going to happen, alpha effects are a nightmare!)
  - Nehahra needs EF_FULLBRIGHT (512) (for alias/bmodel).
  - Nehahra needs svc_showlmp (35), svc_hidelmp (36).
  - Nehahra needs svc_skybox (37).
  - Nehahra needs play2 command.
  - Nehahra needs TE_EXPLOSION3 (16).
  - Nehahra needs TE_LIGHTNING4NEH (17).
  - Nehahra probably needs EF_NODRAW (16).
    (CONFLICTS WITH QW!!!)
  - Nehahra needs RestoreGame QC callback (called when savegame is loaded).
  - Nehahra needs lots of other things...
  - gl_colorlights can/should be made to work without +set
  - BloodBath needs sv_stepheight cvar to control how much players step up
  - BloodBath needs automatic step-up while airborn (Blood/Q2/Q3 style),
    even though this does allow strafe jumping...  a physics glitch allowing
    people to jump faster, farther, and higher, than normally possible, when
    jumping up very steep stairs in the right conditions (double/triple jump).
  - BloodBath needs different sbar.
  - BloodBath needs different key bindings menu.
  - Cosmetic bug: The new particles look cool, but some people would
    prefer the original GLQuake particles just for nostalgia value.  We
    should support that. (Likely won't happen.)
