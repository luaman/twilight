Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

Bugs we know about:

  - Sometimes a client will not die on crash properly because somehow the
    SDL sound thread doesn't get told to die.  We need to fix this.
  - Damm could demonstrate lightmap corruption consistantly with certain
    maps, if he still can we need to fix it.
  - Some OpenGL state changes lost in QW, particularly things like alpha
    in the console and in crosshairs is missing.
  - MacOS X sound is "choppy", not sure if this is SDL's problem or ours.
    Seems that tweaking snd_mixahead fixes it, but that's not a good fix,
    need someone who understands SDL sound on MacOS X to look at it..
  - share/userpath mkdir handling is still kinda borked.
  - QF asks for models as eg, /progs/backpack.mdl - totally incompatible
    with 2.40.  No idea if it works with Id's stuff, but there are just
    enough QF servers out there that we have to make it work.

New stuff slated for 0.2.0:

  - QW/NQ renderers - port changes between them
  - "lighthalf" gamma table doubling trick
  - faster dlights if we can make them faster
  - particle torches

Would be nice but is not strictly needed:

  - LordHavoc's software brightness/contrast support - looks different
    than our texture gamma, but it can be done at runtime which is a big
    problem with our stuff.
  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Build a seperate dedicated server in NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Prettiness features all around
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
  - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
  - Convert Cvars from an unsorted list to a hash
