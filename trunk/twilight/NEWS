NEWS for Project Twilight

[ This file contains all known updates/changes to
  Project Twilight that are different from id's
  standard Quake I distributions ]
-------------------------------------------------

2001-09-14 09:02  digiman
        Twilight does not draw skybox if sky was not initialized
        (no sky surfaces).

2001-09-14 07:15  knghtbrd
        Added fs_gamename cvar, needed for Debian packages

2001-09-13 07:36  knghtbrd
        Shared and user configuration files for settings that can't be in your
        autoexec files are now supported.  fs_shareconf and fs_userconf are the
        cvars, and can be +set as you'd expect to change defaults.

2001-09-12 22:15  lordhavoc
        Fix for e3m3.bsp bizarre broken rotated physics (in other words: clear 
        the angles on world when loading)

2001-09-11 04:46  lordhavoc
        Added DarkPlaces texture resampling code, should improve load times 
        r_lerpimages        1        smooth resampling
        r_lerpimages        0        old style

2001-09-11 04:14  mercury
        2-5% speed increase due to an OpenGL state change audit...

2001-09-11 03:38  mercury
        Fixed COM_StripExtension to strip the last ., not the first.  Oh, it 
        also won't strip off a directory

2001-09-10 13:27  digiman
        Added skybox support to twilight-nq and twilight-qw. Use skybox cvar to
        load skyboxes

2001-09-10 03:43  knghtbrd
        "Key unbound, press F4 to bind" message removed entirely. How does it
        know what I have F4 bound to?  And why does it happen for some keys but 
        not others?  And spamming the console because I hold down a key that
        isn't bound or something? Maybe I bumped it?  No, this message has to
        go.

2001-09-09 19:13  knghtbrd
        QuakeForge's console background was much better than ours. I should know
        since I did the console        background stuff.  The useful changes have been
        brought over, along with the Cvars cl_verstring and gl_constretch.
        Unlike QF, gl_constretch defaults to on, it looks nifty with the id
        conback, so deal with it.  =)

2001-09-09 18:58  eviltypeguy
        Changed "Hardware Brightness" to "Hardware Gamma" on graphics options
        menu

2001-09-09 18:45  eviltypeguy
        Fixed twilight-nq hardware brightness slider on the options menu
        to work like the other sliders...

2001-09-09 17:59  knghtbrd
        Added preliminary Debian packaging scripts, currently with an undeclared
        dep on gamedata and I want to break the dedicated server out into
        its own package but they DO work if you replace the auto* symlinks
        with real files - make dist will build its tarball like that, which
        I needed to tweak a couple of the Makefile.am's to get working.

2001-09-09 10:32  zinx
        Removed cl_predict_players2 cvar. It didn't make any sense to
        have it, as cl_predict_players and cl_predict_players2 were always
        checked together...

2001-09-09 07:30  digiman
        Fixed the rest of dynamic lights in twilght-qw and twilight-nq. Also
        fixed a crash in after map change if in 32 bit mode.

2001-09-09 07:25  mercury
        Added hardware gamma support...
        For my next trick I might make the cshifts alter the gamma bias
        instead of drawing the big polys on the screen! *cackle*
        NOTE: The new gamma system is NOT compatible with the old one,
        the cvars and other things have changed, use the graphics options menu
        to change settings for now

2001-09-08 15:53  digiman
        Dynamic SDL linkage: to win32 applications (nq and qw), you must
        have SDL.dll

2001-09-08 12:39  digiman
        Added show_fps cvar to twilight-nq and set fps_counter to 0 by default
        in twilight-qw

2001-09-07 11:06  digiman
        Added mipmapping routines from Mesa by Brian Paul.

2001-09-07 10:33  digiman
        Added tga and pcx modules (support?)

2001-09-06 18:18  knghtbrd
        It's possible to make the menu think you're in a game with a console
        open simply by opening one and typing "disconnect".  This causes the
        menu to        refuse to open, thinking instead that it should close the
        console. Fixed.        We now set key_dest == key_console after we init the
        host, probably other places need to set key_dest still, the diff for
        Mercury's new key code has them all covered.  Mouse wheel works
        fine, but can spit out warnings about unbound keys if you don't
        bind the wheel, even when using it to scroll the console. Cleaning
        up the key_dest state changes will fix that.

2001-09-02 07:12  digiman
        Dedicated server doesn't overwrite config.cfg

2001-09-01 17:27  digiman
        Added -bpp command line option for color depth setting

2001-08-31 13:38  digiman
        Added gl_oldlights cvar to disable PVS dynamic lights

2001-08-30 23:56  eviltypeguy
        GL_TEXTUREMODE is now a graphics options menu item, so users don't have
        to go digging through cvar land to set texture quality...

2001-08-30 23:56  eviltypeguy
        Fixed up bad texture mode message, added sane default if user put in a
        bogus value

2001-08-30 21:28  eviltypeguy
        gl_texturemode is now a cvar and not a command (I consider the old way
        to be a bug, so do others :) Basically, this means that anal players
        like me can have gl_linear_mipmap_linear automagically enabled for them,
        and since it's a cvar with cvar_archive set, it's automatically saved on
        quit into the user's .cfg file...

2001-08-27 18:21  eviltypeguy
        Added back frame interpolation and fullbright models options to graphics
        options menu, setup fullbright option to change both gl_fb_models, and
        gl_fb_bmodels, so fullbright is applied or not applied respectively to
        both types of models...

2001-08-26 20:53  eviltypeguy
        Added controllable waterwarp to twilight-nq and twilight-qw:
        r_waterwarp 0 = disabled r_waterwarp > 0 = intensity
        examples:
        r_waterwarp 1 = very subtle r_waterwarp 8 = id default
        r_waterwarp 50 = trippy

2001-08-26 19:17  knghtbrd
        fs_userpath/fs_sharepath cvars exist now

2001-08-25 21:35  eviltypeguy
        Added software brightness and contrast control (ported from lordhavoc's
        darkplaces) Looks sweet!

2001-08-25 14:52  digiman
        Fullbright models are rendered with multitexturing now

2001-08-25 10:00  digiman
        PVS dynamic lights work now. HUGE speedup.'r_shadows 2' is back.

2001-08-25 00:00  knghtbrd
        shutter glasses support removed since it doesn't work in OpenGL

2001-08-24 23:58  eviltypeguy
        corrected key repeating for both twilight-nq & twilight-qw now repeats
        if the key is bound for the console and it's not the pause key no matter
        what, this makes for useful key repeat

2001-08-24 22:54  eviltypeguy
        addition of key repeat for twilight-qw and twilight-nq controllable just
        through these cvars:
        in_key_repeat_delay in_key_repeat_interval
        (milliseconds & characters a second respectively)

2001-08-24 16:42  lordhavoc
        removed gl_smoothmodels cvar (and corresponding        affine models graphics
        option). Removed all setting of glShadeModel (the GL default is
        smooth) sped up player model check in CL_LinkPacketEntities (uses
        cl_playerindex like the CL_LinkPlayers code)

2001-08-22 21:57  eviltypeguy
        Beep the user in twilight-nq and let them know it couldn't match
        anything for tab completion.
        
        For twilight-qw, let the user know it couldn't match anything for tab
        completion.

2001-08-22 07:29  digiman
        Improved chasecam.

2001-08-22 06:45  molivier
        Add +use support.

2001-08-21 23:57  eviltypeguy
        Added bash-style-like tab completion for twilight-nq & twilight-qw
        
        It basically works like so: c<tab>
        <===============================================================>
        X possible commands:
        color      connect         changing   cd              
        clear           centerview    cmd
        
        X possible variables:
        cl_chasecam            cl_hightrack.......
        Enjoy!
        
        This could change drastically in the future....

2001-08-21 21:04  eviltypeguy
        Added early +set execute fix to twilight-qwsv

2001-08-21 15:40  digiman
        Added fullbright texture support on models, bmodels and player model
        skins for twilight-qw and twilight-nq.

2001-08-19 17:55  eviltypeguy
        Fix early +set execution for twilight-nq & twilight-qw, this allows a
        user to do:
        twilight-nq +set gl_driver "blah.so", since once the engine has
        started it is not possible to change the gl_driver...

2001-08-16 17:54  digiman
        Added big-endian machines support for skins (future work)

2001-08-16 17:50  digiman
        Fixed some misc. particle system bugs...

2001-08-14 05:11  digiman
        Enabled rotating bmodels support in twilight-nq

2001-08-13 18:11  knghtbrd
        In Linux, you may now specify --with-opengl=libWhateverGL.so.something
        to pick your compiled-in default for GL library.  ./configure will tell
        you what it's set to. Win32 gets opengl32.dll as normal

2001-08-13 17:03  digiman
        Speed up recursive light checking in twilight-nq and twilight-qw this
        version is faster than id's one        and LordHavoc's one too....

2001-08-13 17:01  digiman
        Faster console drawing for twilight-nq and twilight-qw

2001-08-13 16:24  digiman
        Runtime GL library linking works under Windows

2001-08-13 01:58  knghtbrd
        -basedir no longer needed in Linux, also fixed a QW server bug regarding
        the temp1 var..

2001-08-12 07:07  raineth
        Ported model interpolation, fullbright model support, and the graphics
        options        menu from twilight-nq to twilight-qw.

2001-08-12 06:25  digiman
        Speedup - prefind models for temporary entities

2001-08-12 05:03  mercury
        Init the speed cheat protection stuff on client connect.

2001-08-12 04:59  mercury
        Added Speed cheat detection.  Allow connecting clients to see people
        talking.

2001-08-10 13:01  digiman
        Added "Improved" shadows (r_shadows 2).

2001-08-10 13:00  digiman
        Added Advance console editing for twilight-nq

2001-08-10 12:56  digiman
        Enabled rotation bmodels for twilight-nq

2001-08-09 13:18  digiman
        Added some stuff to improve look of models in Shrak (it didn't work
        in Twilight at all) and Dissolution of Eternity.

2001-08-09 07:49  digiman
        Optimized model drawing

2001-08-09 06:51  digiman
        Added movement and frame interpolation to twilight-nq, some small
        changes        to improved look of new maths.

2001-08-08 18:08  digiman
        Fixed a security hole in twilight-nq's network code

2001-08-08 17:48  digiman
        Added -lm_4 command line option to use RGBA format for lightmaps for
        twilight-nq

2001-08-08 15:42  digiman
        Added modflags for indicating if model is fullbright and there's no need
        to calculate ambient and dynamic lighting for it. Modflags also indicate
        if model should not cast shadow or should be double sized (eyes). A LOT
        of models use this flags and look nicer now. There's also a HACK to make
        shells bmodel look nicer (by Tonik) for both twilight-nq and
        twilight-qw.

2001-08-05 17:18  mercury
        Added -nomouse option to twilight-qw

2001-08-04 12:38  knghtbrd
        Say bye bye to the remaining vestiges of IPX and serial support.  We
        don't actually support these things, better not to have code which
        claims we do.

2001-07-30 12:48  mercury
        A few fixes for mouse input. (Wheel supported, movement is done a /lot/
        saner.) for twilight-qw

2001-07-30 01:00  knghtbrd
        Made SHAREPATH default to ${datadir}/games/twilight by default in unix.

2001-07-28 09:27  digiman
        Greatly optimized Draw_String and Draw_Alt_String as LordHavoc
        requested. (makes messages displayed on screen not effect performance
        nearly as much...)

2001-07-10 15:55  knghtbrd
        Remove IDGODS stuff. Bwahahaha, it's been 18 months since I've seen
        that.

2001-07-09 08:52  knghtbrd
        Removed more 3dfx voodoo specific support code
