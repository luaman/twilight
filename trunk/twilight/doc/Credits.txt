Credits for Project: Twilight
-----------------------------

 First and foremost, we would like to thank the people from Id Software for
 bringing Quake(R) and QuakeWorld(R) to the world in the first place.  The
 source code included an incomplete list of those responsible, here they
 are:

      Adrian Carmack            John Romero
      American McGee            Kevin Cloud
      Barrett Alexander         Michael Abrash
      Christian Antkow          Mike Wilson
      Dave Kirsch               Nine Inch Nails
      Donna Jackson             Paul Steed
      Jack Mathews              Sandy Petersen
      Jay Wilbur                Shawn Green
      John Carmack              Tim Willits
      John Cash                 Todd Hollenshead


 But even beyond that, we'd like to thank John Carmack and Dave Kirsch for
 their work to bring us the release of the source code under the GNU GPL,
 and of course for answering our silly questions with lots of good advice
 (such as the reassurance that we're crazy, for example..)


 Project: Twilight makes extensive use of Sam Lantinga's Simple Directmedia
 Layer, a library designed to make cross-platform multimedia development
 practical.  Thanks Sam!  Without SDL, we might have started to believe
 Dave's assertions about our sanity long ago.

 And last, but absolutely not least, the people who have contributed code
 directly to Project: Twilight at one point or another (whether they know
 about it or not.)  Thanks guys!
