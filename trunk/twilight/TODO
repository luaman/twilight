Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

These things need to be done before public release:

  - replacement md4.c, ours is a GPL violation

  - Mercury's key system updates
    - agree on names for KGT_*
    - documentation of the new key system
    - code needs porting to NQ
    - new defaults for Id, mission packs, and anything else we find
    - conversion tool for old configs

  - Sys_ExpandPath, for twiddle expansion, / normalization, etc

  - Dynamic OpenGL binding

  - New Cvar system
    - finish in NQ
    - port to QW
    - add callbacks where helpful
    - convert from list to hash

  - Documentation, we've changed enough that this is necessary

  ? Other stuff, not required for release, rated 1-9 for importance
    1 SDL audio, massive portability bonus to doing this now
    1 Fix Targa loader
    4 Menu overhaul, perhaps following tQER model for now
    4 Console font
    7 Knghtbrd's server console


Stuff that can probably wait:

  - Add PNG loader
  - Zip archive support
  - The New Protocol(TM)
  - Enhance the binds menu for new features?
  - improve sin/cos lookup tables and stop using the math.h functions
  - Cvar improvements
    - Implement CVAR_TEMP for progs-created vars
    - Implement Cvar_Clean to delete CVAR_TEMPs that aren't CVAR_USER
    - Implement flag manipulation functions for internal use
