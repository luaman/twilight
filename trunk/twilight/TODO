Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

These things need to be done before first public release:

  - replacement md4.c, ours is a GPL violation
  - Make SDL_CDStatus calls less often for win32
  - Sys_ExpandPath, for twiddle expansion, / normalization, etc
  - Dynamic OpenGL binding
  - Port new Cvar system to QW
  - Documentation, we've changed enough that this is necessary


Would be nice, in importance order:

  - Fix targa loader
  - Produce a dedicated server for NQ
  - Convert Cvars from list to hash
  - SDL audio, massive portability bonus to doing this now
  - Rid ourselves of the monolithic header
  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Prettiness features all around
  - Console font
  - Use callbacks for Cvars where appropriate
  - Menu overhaul
  - Knghtbrd's server console
  - Change resolutions in-game


Stuff that can wait:

  - Add PNG loader
  - Zip archive support


Stuff that definitely should wait:

  - The New Protocol(TM)
  - Cvar improvements
    - Implement CVAR_TEMP for progs-created vars
    - Implement Cvar_Clean to delete CVAR_TEMPs that aren't CVAR_USER
    - Implement flag manipulation functions for internal use
