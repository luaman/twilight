Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

Bugs we know about:

  - Sometimes a client will not die on crash properly because somehow the
    SDL sound thread doesn't get told to die.  We need to fix this.
  - Damm could demonstrate lightmap corruption consistantly with certain
    maps, if he still can we need to fix it.
  - Some OpenGL state changes lost in QW, particularly things like alpha
    in the console and in crosshairs is missing.
  - MacOS X sound is "choppy", not sure if this is SDL's problem or ours.
  - share/userpath mkdir handling is still kinda borked.

New stuff slated for 0.2.0:

  - QW/NQ renderers - port changes between them
  - "lighthalf" gamma table doubling trick
  - faster dlights if we can make them faster

Would be nice but is not strictly needed:

  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Server browser
  - sv_model.c for NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Build a seperate dedicated server in NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Prettiness features all around
  - Console font [Knghtbrd]
  - Menu overhaul
  - Knghtbrd's server console
  - Add PNG loader
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
  - SDL improvements
    - Remove Quake-specific simple datatypes which SDL gives us
    - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
    - Replace Quake library functions with SDL functions
  - Cvar improvements
    - Convert from an unsorted list to a hash
    - Implement flag manipulation functions for internal use
    - Use Cvar callbacks for Cvar bounds checking and internal updates
  - Command-specific tab completion (set, map, etc)


Stuff that definitely should wait:

  - The New Protocol(TM)
  - Zip archive support
  - Design a new HUD system
  - Change resolutions in-game
  - New key system.
