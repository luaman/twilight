Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

Bugs we know about:

  - Damm can demonstrate lightmap corruption consistantly with certain
    maps at certain times.  He can't reproduce it at will, but it does
    happen.
  - QF asks for models as eg, /progs/backpack.mdl - totally incompatible
    with 2.40.  No idea if it works with Id's stuff, but there are just
    enough QF servers out there that we have to make it work.

New stuff slated for 0.2.0:

  - QW/NQ renderers - port changes between them
  - faster dlights if we can make them faster

stuff slate for EvilTypeGuy for 0.2.0:
  - clean up the menus, make sure all cvar graphics options
    are listed on the graphics options menu in both nq/qw
  - clean up the Cmd system, make sure that all the _init,
    init_cvars routines are still clean and proper

Would be nice but is not strictly needed:

  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Build a seperate dedicated server in NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
  - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
  - Convert Cvars from an unsorted list to a hash
