Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

Bugs we know about:

  - Damm can demonstrate lightmap corruption consistantly with certain
    maps at certain times.  He can't reproduce it at will, but it does
    happen.
  - lights do not react to moving bmodels, untransforming into the
    bmodel's coordinates would fix this.  This is a stock Quake bug.
  - Quake never checked BSPs very well, a bad one can crash the engine.
  - Cosmetic bug: The new particles look cool, but some people would
    prefer the original GLQuake particles just for nostalgia value.  We
    should support that.
  - Twilight uses far too much memory.  Textures should be freed when they
    are uploaded for one, and we should use fewer big static buffers.

New stuff slated for 0.2.0:

stuff slate for EvilTypeGuy for 0.2.0:
  - clean up the menus, make sure all cvar graphics options
    are listed on the graphics options menu in both nq/qw
  - clean up the Cmd system

Would be nice but is not strictly needed:

  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Build a seperate dedicated server in NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
  - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
  - Convert Cvars from an unsorted list to a hash
  - Use traceline to determine visibility (trace from eye to random places
    in entity bbox), with 1 second visibility timeout (if traceline
    succeeds, reset timeout to realtime + 1), this is as fast as pvs
    checking, and much more effective, use this in server and optionally
    client
  - Add back mirrors at some point
  - DarkPlaces has better lighting which we should port over to Twilight
    (R_BuildLightList and R_AddDynamicLights, rdlight_t stuff)
  - Implement stainmaps (ie, blood staining the lightmaps)a
  - Rewrite the sound code so that it is possible to spit out a timed
    sound file which matches frame outputs (for recording videos)
  - Add {gl,cl}_weirdshit.c to support Nehahra.  ;)
