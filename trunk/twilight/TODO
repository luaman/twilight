Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

Bugs we know about:

  - Sometimes a client will not die on crash properly because somehow the
    SDL sound thread doesn't get told to die.  We need to fix this.
  - Damm could demonstrate lightmap corruption consistantly with certain
    maps, if he still can we need to fix it.
  - Some OpenGL state changes lost in QW, particularly things like alpha
    in the console and in crosshairs is missing.
  - MacOS X sound is "choppy", not sure if this is SDL's problem or ours.
    Seems that tweaking snd_mixahead fixes it, but that's annoying.
  - share/userpath mkdir handling is still kinda borked.
  - QF asks for models as eg, /progs/backpack.mdl - totally incompatible
    with 2.40.  No idea if it works with Id's stuff, but there are just
    enough QF servers out there that we have to make it work.

New stuff slated for 0.2.0:

  - QW/NQ renderers - port changes between them
  - "lighthalf" gamma table doubling trick
  - faster dlights if we can make them faster
  - model.c, cl_model.c, sv_model.c [Vic]

Would be nice but is not strictly needed:

  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Server browser
  - Build a seperate dedicated server in NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Prettiness features all around
  - Console font [Knghtbrd]
  - Menu overhaul
  - Knghtbrd's server console
  - Add PNG loader
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
  - SDL improvements
    - Remove Quake-specific simple datatypes which SDL gives us
    - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
  - Cvar improvements
    - Convert from an unsorted list to a hash
    - Implement flag manipulation functions for internal use
    - Use Cvar callbacks for Cvar bounds checking and internal updates
  - Command-specific tab completion (set, map, etc)


Stuff that definitely should wait:

  - The New Protocol(TM)
  - Zip archive support
  - Design a new HUD system
  - Change resolutions in-game
  - New key system.
