Project Twilight todo list
--------------------------

These things should be done before first public release:

  - Global config file support
  - Website updates
    - MySQL-based news [CoderJoe]
    - Important non-project files
    - Releases page
    - Credits page
    ? A few links to important sites
    - Overview update to reflect changing project dynamics
    - CVS walktrhoughs
    - Anything else we can get done by release date
  - Packaging scripts
    - Debian
    - RPM
    ? Something for win32?
  - Hardware gamma/brightness support [EvilTypeGuy]
  - Working mousewheel support [EvilTypeGuy]
  - Fix QW sky


Would be nice but is not strictly needed, in importance order:

  - Rid ourselves of the monolithic header in NQ
  - Merge QW server into QW client ala NQ
  - Test -dedicated to make sure there are no nasty surprises [LordHavoc]
  - sv_model.c for NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Build a seperate dedicated server in NQ [LordHavoc]
  - Nightly CVS snapshots [Knghtbrd]
  - Prettiness features all around
  - Console font [Knghtbrd]
  - Menu overhaul
  - Knghtbrd's server console
  - Make water warping optional, and the intensity of it
    controllable via cvars, and menu, most likely off
    by default for QW, and on by default for NQ

Stuff that can wait:

  - Add PNG loader
  - Move Quake library functions used by all targets and tools to a common
    directory (zone, mathlib, qtypes, compat, part of console, etc)
  - SDL improvements
    - Replace snd_* with SDL-based audio
    - MacOS/MacOS X ports
    - Remove Quake-specific simple datatypes which SDL gives us
    - switch to using specific-sized SDL variables for file accesses
    - Replace Quake library functions with SDL functions
  - Cvar improvements
    - Convert from an unsorted list to a hash
    - Implement flag manipulation functions for internal use
    - Use Cvar callbacks for Cvar bounds checking and internal updates
  - Command-specific tab completion (set, map, etc)


Stuff that definitely should wait:

  - The New Protocol(TM)
  - Zip archive support
  - Design a new HUD system
  - Change resolutions in-game
  - New key system.
