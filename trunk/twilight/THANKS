  First and foremost, we would like to thank the people who brought Quake(R)
  and QuakeWorld(R) to the world.  Without them, we wouldn't be here today.
  They include:

      Adrian Carmack            John Romero
      American McGee            Kevin Cloud
      Barrett Alexander         Michael Abrash
      Christian Antkow          Mike Wilson
      Dave Kirsch               Nine Inch Nails
      Donna Jackson             Paul Steed
      Jack Mathews              Sandy Petersen
      Jay Wilbur                Shawn Green
      John Carmack              Tim Willits
      John Cash                 Todd Hollenshead

      ...and the thousands of others who made this game great!


  But even beyond the great game we all became addicted to in 1996, these
  guys have made Project Twilight possible:

    John Carmack
      The GNU GPL source code release
      Answering our silly questions
    
    Dave Kirsch
      The GNU GPL source code release
      Lots of advice and explanations

    Sam Lantinga
      Simple Directmedia Layer
      Initial work on SDLQuake

    VA Linux Systems
      SourceForge services

  And last but certainly not least, we'd like to thank everyone who has
  contributed to Project Twilight.  They are listed in the file named
  AUTHORS in the same directory as this file.
