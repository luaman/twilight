This is the embedded gamedata which will be included in a compiled
binary, this is desirable because this gives us basic minimal
functionality in the event of being able to locate NOTHING.

This is also desirable because it allows us to move things (such as the
menu) to gamedata, while still giving people who just have the ID
gamedata the basic functionality.

Everything here is at the END of the search path, and thus will only be
used if nothing else of the given name can be found.

To add files to this, edit Makefile.am and add deps to the
embedded_data.fs rule.
