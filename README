Installing Project Twilight
---------------------------

  Recommended system

    In order to be able to fully enjoy Project Twilight as intended, we
    recommend the following minimum system.  Less might work, but might be
    somewhat disappointing:

    - 133 MHz processor (May vary for non-x86 systems)
    - 16 megabytes available memory
    - Voodoo2-class accellerated 3D video card
    - Full OpenGL 1.2 driver implemenetation


  More docs will be written, this is just our first release, so it's a bit
  rough around the edges.  Mostly things work just as they do for OpenGL
  versions of Quake(R) and QuakeWorld(R).  The differences that affect end
  users are listed in the NEWS file.

  Keep an eye on http://twilight.sf.net/ for updates!
